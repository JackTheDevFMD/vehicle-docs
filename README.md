Welcome to our open-source documentation for vehicle developers!

This documentation is meant to serve as more than an exhaustive list of variables and values. The goal of these documents is to help developers learn and understand the development process, as well as provide best practices and tutorials.

If you're looking for a a full record of all variables and values without commentary or best practices, see [the GTAMods Wiki.](https://gtamods.com/wiki/Main_Page)
