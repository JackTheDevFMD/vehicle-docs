# Contribution Guidelines

These documents are meant to be as objective as possible, any opinions or first person writing is frowned upon. 
Something like 
> There are a total of 8 different siren delta values.

is much better than:
> I think there are around 8 different siren delta values.

## Headings
Try to fit what you have under an existing H1, H2, or H3 section before making a new one. We want as few H1 headers as possible.

## Formatting
Keep things formatted as uniformly as possible. We want these documents to have a clear hierarchy and a consistent style for easy reading.

## Grammar and Spelling
Grammar and spelling are important to making sure these documents stay easily readable. We can correct minor mistakes, but please make it easier on us.

## External Sources
Feel free to copy-paste things from other places, but ensure you credit the original author, and provide a link to the original content.
